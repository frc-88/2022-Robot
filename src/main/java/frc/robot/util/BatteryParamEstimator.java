/**
 * DESCRIPTION: <br>
 * Battery parameter estimator - calculates an estimate for a battery's open circuit voltage (Voc)
 * and equivilant series resistance (ESR) based on a windows of system current/voltage measurements.
 * Ensures enough spread in the measurement window to ensure confidence in the estimate. Based on a
 * whitepaper detailing an algorithm developed for the 2016 FRC season by FRC1736 RobotCasserole.
 * <br>
 * The constants for the initial parameter estimate were tuned assuming a freshly charged,
 * relatively new MK ES17-12 battery (from andymark). It should self-adjust to whatever battery you
 * put in. However, if you seen a giant jump at the start of each match, you may wish to update the
 * "*init" constants to more accurately represent your "nominal" initial system state. <br>
 * <br>
 * Whitepaper link: <a href="../../../../../../../../doc/current_limiting.pdf">Current
 * Estimation</a>. <br>
 * <br>
 * USAGE:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instantiate Class</li>
 * <li>Once per periodic loop, call the updateEstimate() method to calculate a new paramater
 * estimate</li>
 * <li>After updateEstimate(), call the other getters to utilize the estimated parameters.</li>
 * </ol>
